I haven't provided the dataset bcoz of its size....

so i provided the link of the dataset which i used to train my bot...

I was only able to download one month of reddit comments and it was 5GB large highly compressed.

after extracting the dataset....it grows up to 29 GB :) 

...............
First install:

then follow the steps :

1. run chatbot_databse.py
2. run create_training_data.py
3. run train.py
4. run main.py (which is an interactive chatbot after training)
